    "Waves are a defining characteristic of water-bodies worldwide, transporting energy that impacts numerous physical and ecological processes. Since World War II, there has been a substantial increase in scientific understanding of wave formation, propagation and resulting impacts on coastal and marine features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial wave studies were restricted to data from voluntary ship observations, which were limited in accuracy and sample size, particularly during extreme conditions. The development of technology such as wave buoys has provided accurate, hourly data of wave height, period and direction. This data enables almost immediate knowledge of the **sea state**, which is the present wave conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "    In Australia, waves have been officially recorded since 1974 with the deployment of the first Waverider buoy in Port Kembla, New South Wales (`Hemer et al. 2007 <https://www.jstor.org/stable/26481627?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents>`_). This was the start of an increasing network of *buoys*, *High-Frequency radars* and other wave measurement technology leading to significant knowledge of wave dynamics around the Australian coastline. A further technological leap in wave monitoring was achieved in 1985, with the launch of the `GEOSAT <https://earth.esa.int/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/g/geosat>`_ satellites with a mounted *altimeter*. As a remote sensing technique, altimeters provide wave data observations with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution (`Ribal & Young 2019 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0083-9>`_). Long-term analysis of wave conditions can lead to the characterisation of a wave climate, which is the modal wave conditions of an area (`Godoi et al. 2016 <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015JC011572>`_).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variation from the modal wave climate can occur due to *extreme events* such as large **storms**, **Tropical Cyclones** (TC) or **tsunamis**. For Australia, it is critical to understand these extreme conditions and to analyse their role in ecological disturbance, as well as to predict present and future vulnerability, particularly with anthropogenic climate change likely to increase the frequency of intense TCs along our coasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wave climate of a region is further impacted by **climate oscillations**, which are semi-regular cyclical changes that have well-defined effects on regional and global weather patterns. These fluctuations typically influence atmospheric temperature, sea surface temperature, wind or precipitation. Oscillations operate on different timescales and can therefore occur together, enhancing or diminishing the effects of each event (`Godoi et al. 2019 <https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.5823>`_). A key example is the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (**ENSO**), which plays an integral role in climate modulation over the Pacific Ocean and surrounding continents. Both the Australian modal and extreme wave climates can be substantially influenced by these climate oscillations, primarily due to changes in wind patterns and changes to extreme event frequency and intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave formation\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Ocean waves are formed by different mechanisms and as a result, can have a wide range of properties. In this course, we focus on **ocean surface gravity waves** (henceforth referred to as waves), also known as *wind-generated waves*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".. important::\n",
    "\n",
    "  At the atmosphere-ocean interface, kinetic wind energy is transferred to the ocean, which with sufficient wind, generate waves (`Holthuijsen 2007 <https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/waves-in-oceanic-and-coastal-waters/F6BF070B00266943B0ABAFEAE6F54465>`_). Several factors influence wave formation, including the *strength* and *duration* of the wind, and the *fetch*, the distance over open ocean which the wind blows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When wind blows over only a short distance, wind-waves are formed. In Australia, these locally-generated waves typically have a short period of **1-8 s**, and travel slower than the prevailing wind. In contrast, swell-waves are generated by distant storms and have propagated out of the wave-generation area. Swell has a longer period of **8-30 s**, and is only minimally influenced by local wind conditions. In many instances, these two wave types occur simultaneously and can travel in opposite directions, creating chaotic seas.\n",

    "Wave Parameters\n",
    "*****************\n",
    "\n",
    "Waves can be characterised by parameters such as *wave period*, *height*, *power* and *direction*. Distinctions between different wave classes are based on these measurements and are used to describe both individual waves and the wave climate of a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertical distance between the maximum and minimum surface elevation over one wave period is referred to as **wave height** (`Holthuijsen 2007 <https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/waves-in-oceanic-and-coastal-waters/F6BF070B00266943B0ABAFEAE6F54465>`_). To define the overall wave height of many waves, typically the significant wave height is calculated (:math:`H_{s}`). Mathematically, :math:`H_{s}` is the mean of the highest third of waves in a given sample period (`Holthuijsen 2007 <https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/waves-in-oceanic-and-coastal-waters/F6BF070B00266943B0ABAFEAE6F54465>`_); traditionally, it is the height a trained observer would see when attempting to estimate average wave height, as humans would not see or consider the smallest waves.\n",

    "  Wave height and wave period from a time record of ocean surface elevation, defined by downward zero-crossings from Holthuijsen (2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wave period** is the time for one full wavelength to pass a given point, from the beginning to the end of the wave (`Holthuijsen 2007 <https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/waves-in-oceanic-and-coastal-waters/F6BF070B00266943B0ABAFEAE6F54465>`_).\n",
    "Usually, the zero-crossing period is used (:math:`T_{z}`) that measures the time for a wave to go below the mean elevation, rise above, then return to mean elevation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As waves propagate across the ocean surface, energy is also transferred, referred to as **wave power** (:math:`P`) or **wave energy flux**. The :math:`P` of each wave is proportional to the :math:`T_{z}` and the square of :math:`H_{s}`, with higher values producing more powerful waves (Airy 1841). This parameter is important as it combines both :math:`H_{s}` and :math:`T_{z}`, providing an overall understanding of the wave conditions and the energy it transports. For example, a wave with a :math:`H_{s}` of 1 m and :math:`T_{z}` of 5 s will have less power than a wave with an :math:`H_{s}` of 1m and :math:`T_{z}` of 8 s.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Propagation direction** (:math:`\\theta`) is the direction from which waves are coming from. In certain regions a particular wave direction can indicate different swell characteristics, for example, large waves from the South-East in Queensland, Australia, indicate strong Southern Ocean swell or Extra-Tropical Cyclone swell, whilst large waves from the north indicate Tropical Cyclone waves.\n",

    "There are numerous techniques that can be used to measure these parameters. However, most methods do not measure all parameters: a deliberate choice must be made, with consideration to the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Frequently, the method chosen is customarily calibrated with other techniques or used in combination.\n",

    "***********\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave buoy data is routinely considered ground truth, as it is a physical measurement of individual waves instead of remote sensing (`Hemer et al. 2007 <https://www.jstor.org/stable/26481627?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents>`_). Buoys also provide the most reliable and accurate records, particularly for extreme values. Despite this, variations in sampling, calibration and computational methods can lead to significant errors by both over and under-estimating wave parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "\n",
    "  `Bender et al. (2010) <https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/2010JTECHO724.1>`_ revealed buoys can overestimate :math:`H_{s}` by 26%, and overestimate during hurricane peak by up to 56%, leading to significant and highly misleading errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buoys are also spatially limited, measuring only waves that propagate directly through the site, leading to a restricted understanding of regional wave climates. Furthermore, many locations do not have buoys in operation, thereby inhibiting the analysis of wave climate through buoys alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave hindcast models\n",
    "***********************\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave hindcast models use **reanalysed wind fields** to investigate **past** waves. Wind speed and duration are required parameters that are calculated alongside fetch and water depth to determine :math:`H_{s}`, :math:`T_{z}` and :math:`\\theta`. This provides data sets that are used globally to establish wave climate and can evaluate conditions at different temporal and spatial scales.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. tip::\n",
    "  A widely used wave hindcast is the *National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration* (NOAA) **WaveWatch III model** (`Tolman 2009 <https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn276/MMAB_276.pdf>`_) as shown in the introduction to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, significant problems can arise through error with forced wind condition. For example, extreme events such as TCs can cause abrupt, localised changes to wind speed and direction. Since models such as **WaveWatch III** have relatively coarse spatial-temporal resolution, insufficient energy from wind is inputted leading to significant underestimation of wave conditions during these extreme events. The accuracy of the hindcast model is also dependent of additional source term parameters and generation, propagation and dissipation equations.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "  In Australia, this is a significant problem in reef areas, where wave propagation is modified substantially by reefs. With coarse spatial detail, identification and accounting for reefs are reduced, thus leading to potentially incorrect wave conditions in areas sheltered by reefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, whilst wave hindcast models can provide excellent information of wave conditions, particularly in areas where there are no buoys, inherent limitations regarding spatial detail and reliance on source terms means that it is currently unsuitable for wave climate characterisation for reef or areas with complicated bathymetry.\n",

    "\n",
    "Radar altimeters are mounted on satellites and measure a footprint of the ocean directly under the satellite, between 5-7 km wide. When the water surface is calm and flat, the reflection of the radar pulse back to the altimeter is almost instantaneous. In contrast, when waves are present the pulse is first reflected at the crest of the wave, then progressively reflected as the pulse reaches the wave trough.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".. important::\n",
    "  The altimeter interprets this signal to determine wave height and wind speed. Therefore, this remote sensing technique **does not provide individual wave statistics**, but rather **returns the average value over the footprint**, up to 7 km wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to a buoy, altimeters provide excellent spatial coverage, with observations along the ground track every second, approximately every 5-7 km. Since the launch of the first altimeter in 1985, (`GEOSAT <https://earth.esa.int/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/g/geosat>`_), altimeters have been used to determine wave climate. With the increased number of altimeters in orbit, the global coverage and temporal density are increasing, resulting in a technology highly suited to characterising wave climate, particularly in areas with no buoys, complicated bathymetry and in remote locations.\n",

    "Several regions of the global ocean have statistically significant positive and negative trends in :math:`H_{s}`. An analysis of 33 years of altimeter data by `Young & Ribal (2019) <https://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6028/451>`_ (see figure above) determined that extreme 90th percentile waves in the Southern Ocean are increasing by 1 cm/year, and in the North Atlantic by 0.8 cm/year. This is often correlated to an increase in extreme wind strength in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "  However we can see some differences, as a matter of fact, despite mean local wind speed increasing globally, the mean :math:`H_{s}` show less explicit trends in all regions. Several areas, such as the Southern Ocean, have a slight positive increase, whilst other regions have slight negative trends. This implies that upper percentile trends are increasing faster than mean trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many regions, such as Southern Australia, can be dominated by swell rather than local wind sea, and therefore increases in mean local wind speed may not have direct effects on the local wave climate. Instead, increasing wind speed in the higher latitudes may increase swell size, which propagates into the middle latitudes.\n",
