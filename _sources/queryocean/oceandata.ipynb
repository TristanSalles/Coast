    "  Now, more than ever, there is a need for regional to global observing systems that can provide accurate real-time data and forecasts on coastal ocean conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean plays a role in everyone’s life. It affects weather and climate patterns around the globe, hosts an abundance of wildlife that support fishing industries and provide food for the world, serves as a highway for vessels that deliver everyday materials, and supports economies as a tourism destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coastal ocean is the part of the earth system where land, water, air, and people meet together. Populations, businesses, and infrastructure are increasing along coastlines, which are all susceptible to changing coastal ocean conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coastal ocean observing systems** (COOS) are necessary for advancing our understanding on the state of the coastal ocean worldwide and its impact on matters of societal importance. These systems integrate a network of people, organisations, technologies, and data to share advances, improve research capabilities, and provide decision-makers with access to information and scientific interpretations.\n",

    "    Data, observations, and models integrated into the **COOS** come from a variety of platforms, including, for example, **moorings**, high-frequency (HF) **radars**, underwater **gliders** and profilers, **satellites**, and **ships**. The resulting data are used to better understand, respond to, and prepare for **short-term** events such as oil spills, harmful algal blooms, and fish kills, **longer term** changes in our oceans resulting in acidification, hypoxia, and sea level rise, and in everyday decisions related to maritime operations, public health, and management of healthy ecosystems.\n",

    "A bit of history\n",
    "********************\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matthew Fontaine Maury** (1806/1873) was an American astronomer, Confederate Navy officer, historian, oceanographer, meteorologist, cartographer, author, geologist, and educator.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was nicknamed **Pathfinder of the Seas** and **Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology** and later, **Scientist of the Seas** for his extensive works in his books, especially *The Physical Geography of the Sea* (1855), the first such extensive and comprehensive book on oceanography to be published. *Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and ocean currents, including ocean lanes for passing ships at sea*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a sailor, Maury noted that there were numerous lessons that had been learned by ship masters about the effects of adverse winds and drift currents on the path of a ship. The captains recorded the lessons faithfully in their logbooks, but they were then forgotten. At the US Naval Observatory, Maury uncovered an enormous collection of thousands of old ships' logs and charts in storage in trunks dating back to the start of the US Navy. He pored over the documents to collect information on winds, calms, and currents for all seas in all seasons. His dream was to put that information in the hands of all captains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maury became convinced that adequate scientific knowledge of the sea could be obtained only by international co-operation. He proposed for the United States to invite the maritime nations of the world to a conference to establish a **universal system** of meteorology, and he was the leading spirit of a pioneer scientific conference when it met in *Brussels in 1853*.\n",

    "  :align: center\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the Brussels Conference, a large number of nations, including many traditional enemies, agreed to co-operate in the sharing of land and sea weather data using uniform standards. It was soon after the Brussels conference that Prussia, Spain, Sardinia, the Free City of Hamburg, the Republic of Bremen, Chile, Austria, and Brazil, and others agreed to joined the enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a few years, nations owning three fourths of the shipping of the world were sending their oceanographic observations to Maury at the Naval Observatory, where the information was evaluated and the results given worldwide distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "  Maury's idea set the scene for what is now a *Global Ocean Observing Infrastructure*! Over the 19th and early 20th century a lot of measurements were made by diverse communities for their **own needs** (scientists, fishermen, commercial navigators…). However as more and more data was collected by divers communities, data was shared only among small communities and was not properly archived and it wasn’t done in a organised way. In situ archeology is a hard job providing questionable databases!\n",

    "Why do we need ocean observing tools?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Until recently, the ocean was viewed as *being an unlimited resource to be exploited* (source: *US National Academies of Science report on Economic Benefits of Oceanographic Research, 1964*).  Subsequent science, including that from national and international observing efforts, has changed what we know about the ocean.\n",
    "\n",

    "Most large-scale coastal ocean observing systems are funded through national governments for their own interests, often with different foci, but the world’s oceans are connected, therefore partnering is the key to success. As an example, the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (`IOOS <https://ioos.noaa.gov>`_), **Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System** (`IMOS <http://imos.org.au>`_), or European Ocean Observing System (`EOOS <http://eurogoos.eu/eoos/>`_) are progressing in their respective regions and are working together to observe and compile ocean information in a way that is easily accessible to scientists and managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMOS** advances have benefited from an evolving set of ocean observing efforts. The envisioned concept was a coordinated national and international network of observations, data management, and analyses that systematically acquired and disseminated data and information on past, present, and future states of the oceans. The coastal ocean observing efforts are implemented via regional programs distributed around coastal regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each program is designed to assess and predict the effects of weather, climate, and human activities on the state of the coastal ocean, its ecosystems and living resources, and on the world’s economy.\n",

    "  The Australian `IMOS <http://imos.org.au>`_ was formed in 2007, with equipment deployed from the next year onward. Scientific ’nodes’ were formed broadly around state boundaries with both nationally unified overarching science goals and local priorities. The **NSW-IMOS** is an example of a successfully implemented ocean observing system along the coast of southeastern Australia. The current observational array is designed around pertinent science questions, leveraged existing data streams, and opportunities for further oceanographic research.\n",

    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a complex task to measure the ocean in ways that deliver useful products for people. For example, to deliver a five-day weather forecast for any local region, meteorologists must sample the whole planet. **Satellites** are key tools that provide multispectral images, atmospheric soundings, and sea surface characteristics needed for these forecasts. While satellites enable us to see through the atmosphere, they can only measure the surface of the ocean, and this does not provide the detail needed for accurate weather prediction. Therefore, we also need a complement of in situ measurements that extend our reach to the depths of the oceans at all relevant scales of phenomena. In situ refers to systems that measure on or under the surface of the ocean in continuous and event-driven modes, automatically and by humans.\n",

It has infrastructures that operate on continental scales, field observing technologies, shares best practices for a broad suite of variables, and generate masses of data. `IMOS <http://imos.org.au>`_ is partner with `IOOS <https://ioos.noaa.gov>`_ and `OTN <https://oceantrackingnetwork.org>`_ (this later is a global ocean research and technology development platform, in the area of animal tagging and tracking). To understand animal movements and survival, you also have to understand how the animals respond to changes in environmental conditions. Thus, the animal tracking effort is tightly integrated with the observation of the physical and chemical environment, and all networks depend on common platforms for oceanographic observations. Other observing technologies include Argo, moored buoys, high-frequency radar (HFR), and autonomous underwater vehicles known as gliders.\n",
