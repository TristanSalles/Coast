    "Longshore drift is induced by longshore current and transport sediments (clay, silt, pebbles, sand and shingle) along coastlines parallel to the shoreline and depends on oblique incoming wave direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oblique incoming waves push water along the coast, and generate a water current which moves parallel to the coast. Longshore drift is the sediment movement associated with this longshore current. This sediment movement occurs within the surf zone.\n",

    "In one-line models, the shoreline is represented by a single line (or contour) that advances or retreats depending on the net alongshore sediment flux. One-line models make a number of simplifying assumptions to conceptualise the coastline allowing the ‘one-line’ representation of the coastline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Short-term cross-shore variations due to storms or rip currents are considered temporary perturbations to the long-term trajectory of coastal change (i.e. the shoreface recovers rapidly from storm-driven cross-shore transport).\n",
    "2. The beach profile is thus assumed to maintain a constant time-averaged form, implying that depth contours are shore-parallel and therefore allows the coast to be represented by a single contour line (right panels in top figure).\n",
    "3. Alongshore sediment transport occurs primarily in the surf zone, and cross-shore sediment transport acts to maintain the equilibrium shoreface as it advances /retreats.\n",
    "4. Alongshore sediment flux occurs due to wave action in the surf zone, parameterized by the height and angle of incidence of breaking waves. Gradients in alongshore transport dictate whether the shoreline advances or retreats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bulk alongshore sediment flux is driven by waves breaking on the shoreface. Typically in alongshore transport laws, flux depends on the height $H_b$ and angle $\\alpha_b$ of breaking waves. For example, the CERC equation is given by:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Q_{ls} = K_{ls} H_b^{5/2} sin(2\\alpha_b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K_{ls}$ is a transport coefficient. The transport coefficient $K_{ls}$ may be modified to account for the size of beach material ($D_{50}$). Calibration of this coefficient can be made from estimates of bulk alongshore transport or by calibration against a historical record of coastal change (*e.g.* [Barkwith et al. (2014)](http://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/2/295/2014/esurf-2-295-2014.html)).\n",

    "Recently, optical imaging satellites have begun to be used to measure the location of the shoreline, which is regarded by coastal managers, planners, engineers and scientists as a key indicator of how coastlines vary and evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, it is possible to use image composites from satellites to map the position of the shoreline with a horizontal accuracy of the order of half a pixel (i.e., **15 m** for Landsat images and **5 m** for Sentinel-2 images).  Some studies have even managed to detect  shoreline at a sub-pixel resolution technique in low-energy microtidal beach and reported horizontal accuracies of less than 10 m using Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images.\n",

    "It enables the non-expert user to extract shorelines from Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images. The shoreline detection algorithm implemented in **CoastSat** is optimised for sandy beach coastlines.

These bays occur in the lee of headlands or man-made coastal structures where erosion and/or littoral drift is inhibited in the face of a dominant direction of wave incidence ([Hurst et al., 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JF003704/abstract)).

The planform morphology will adjust until gradients in alongshore sediment flux are minimised (net alongshore sediment flux is constant). Alongshore sediment flux will be negligible on an equilibrium coastline when there are no external sediment inputs. Subsequent changes in planform morphology may occur such as beach rotation, driven by changes in wave climate characteristics that alter alongshore sediment transport.\n",

For example, it could be driven by boundary conditions provided by wind, wave or surge models and its main outputs (time-varying bathymetry and possibly discharges over breached barrier island sections) could be then transferred back.\n",
